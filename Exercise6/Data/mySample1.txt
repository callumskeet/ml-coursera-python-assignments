Hi username,

Graphic Repl Improvements 

Teams for Education updates

We promised we would improve the graphics quality of our repls, and this is where we start. The native graphics experience is faster, more reliable, and elegant. Common issues like applications not launching and window resizing have been fixed. In addition, to improve the Java swing experience, all Java repls now have 4x the power to compile code. If you’re a nerd like us and are interested in the changes we made, check out our article https://blog.repl.it/native-graphics-love on our new system.

Teachers and educators can now bulk share assignments on Teams for Education! This means that if you’re managing multiple classrooms on repl.it, it’s easier than ever to share your work across your classes and even with other teachers! On a side note, January 31st is the day when we’re ending access to our legacy Classroom product. When you make the switch https://repl.it/classroom-migration, this is one of the many benefits you can look forward to. For more information, see our blog post https://blog.repl.it/teamsforedu-01-22-2021.

One of the fastest languages around just made an appearance as a repl.it curriculum. Please welcome Intro to C++ https://docs.repl.it/curriculum/introCpp from Alfonso Torres. A course that lets teachers and educators easily impart the ability to program in C++ into their students. If you’re a student or self learner, feel free to take these resources and learn from them as well. You can find all the great tutorials Alfonso Torres created here https://docs.repl.it/curriculum/introCpp.

Did you know, a while back our CEO created a tool so you could examine how many times a repl website is opened. A repler found the tool, and used it to create ReplStats. ReplStats allows you to view how many people opened your website on repl.it over the course of many days. You can see how many people opened THIS newsletter in their browser here https://stats.irethekid.repl.co/stats/Newsletter-Tundra-Wolves.util.repl.co, or see how your own repls have done https://repl.it/talk/share/ReplStats-Search-analytics-data-for-web-REPLs/116428.
